#About this repository

This repository contains various tools Standard Ebooks uses to produce its ebooks.

##british2american

Try to convert British quote style to American quote style in DIRECTORY/src/epub/text/.

Quotes must already be "typogrified"--i.e. curly.

This script isn't perfect; proofreading is required, especially near closing quotes near to em-dashes.

##build

Build an ebook from a Standard Ebook source directory and place the output in DIRECTORY/dist/.

##build-cover

Build an ebook cover a Standard Ebook source directory and place the output in DIRECTORY/src/epub/images/.

##clean

Prettify source files in a Standard Ebook source directory, including canonicalizing XML and minifying SVGs. Note that this only prettifies the source code; it doesn't perform typography changes.

##create-draft

Create a skeleton of a new Standard Ebook.

##dec2roman

Convert a decimal number to a Roman numeral.

##endnotes2kindle

Convert epub-friendly endnotes to Kindle-friendly popup endnotes.

##find-mismatched-diacritics

Find words with mismatched diacritics in Standard Ebook source directories.  For example, 'cafe' in one file and 'caf√©' in another.

##find-unused-selectors

Find unused local.css CSS selectors in Standard Ebook source directories.

##generate-opds

Generate the "All Standard Ebooks" OPDS feed and send to standard output.

##generate-words

Generate the `words` file used by the `modernize-hyphenation` script and print to standard output.

##hyphenate

Insert soft hyphens at syllable breaks in an XHTML file.

##interactive-sr

A macro for calling Vim to interactively search and replace a regex on a list of files.

##make-url-safe

Convert all arguments to URL-safe strings.

##modernize-hyphenation

Replace words that may be archaically compounded with a dash to a more modern spelling.  For example, replace "ash-tray" with "ashtray".

##ordinal

Print the ordinal for one or more integers.

##prepare-release

Calculate the ebook's word count, and update content.opf and colophon.xhtml with release and modified timestamps.

##print-manifest-and-spine

Create a <manifest> and <spine> tag for content.opf based on the passed Standard Ebooks source directory and print to standard output.

##reading-ease

Calculate the Flesch reading ease for a Standard Ebooks source directory.

##roman2dec

Convert a Roman numeral to a decimal number.

##semanticate

Apply some scriptable semantics rules from the Standard Ebooks semantics manual to a Standard Ebook source directory.

##simplify-tags
Simplify some HTML and CSS to be more compatible with crappier reading systems (ADE I'm looking at you...)

##split-file

Split an XHTML file into many files at all instances of <!--se:split-->, and include a header template for each file.

##titlecase

Convert a string to titlecase.

##toc2kindle

Flatten ToC to be at most 2 levels deep for Kindle compatibility.  Generally only used by the `build` script and not called independently.

##typogrify

Apply some scriptable typography rules from the Standard Ebooks typography manual to a Standard Ebook source directory.

##unicode-names

Display Unicode code points, descriptions, and links to more details for each character in a string.  Useful for differentiating between different flavors of spaces, dashes, and invisible characters like word joiners.

##update-asin

Change the ASIN of a mobi/azw3 file.

##wordcount

Count the number of words in an HTML file and optionally categorize by length.

##view-modified

Check all author directories in the current or specified directory to see if there are changes that need to be committed.

#What a Standard Ebooks source directory looks like

Many of these tools act on Standard Ebooks source directories.  Such directories have a consistent minimal structure:

	.
	|-dist/
	|-images/
	|--cover.jpg
	|--cover.source.jpg
	|--cover.svg
	|--titlepage.svg
	|-src/
	|--epub/
	|---css/
	|----core.css
	|----local.css
	|---images/
	|----cover.svg
	|----titlepage.svg
	|---text/
	|---content.opf
	|---onix.xml
	|---toc.xhtml
	|--META-INF/
	|---container.xml
	|--mimetype

./dist/ contains built ebook files ready for distribution.

./images/ contains source images for the cover and titlepages, as well as ebook-specific source images.  Source images should be in their maximum available resolution, then compressed and placed in ./src/epub/images/ for distribution.

./src/epub/ contains the actual epub files.

#Setting up your build environment

1.	Download and install Calibre: [http://calibre-ebook.com/download](http://calibre-ebook.com/download)

	**Important:** Don't use the version of Calibre included with your system's package manager.  That's almost always an out-of-date version that will cause problems.  Install it by downloading it directly from the Calibre website.

2.	Download and install epubcheck: [https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck/releases](https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck/releases)

	Currently you have to place it in /opt/epubcheck/.

3.	Install other dependencies.  On Ubuntu 15.04, you can do:

		sudo apt-add-repository ppa:svg-cleaner-team/svgcleaner
		sudo apt-get install xsltproc libxml2-utils xmlstarlet libxml-xpath-perl svgcleaner recode html-xml-utils python3-cssselect python3-regex python3-pip librsvg2-bin libimage-exiftool-perl
		pip3 install pyhyphen roman titlecase beautifulsoup4

4.	If you plan on editing cover or titlepage images, make sure the League Spartan and Sorts Mill Goudy fonts are installed on your system: [https://github.com/theleagueof/league-spartan](https://github.com/theleagueof/league-spartan), [https://github.com/theleagueof/sorts-mill-goudy](https://github.com/theleagueof/sorts-mill-goudy)

That should be it!
